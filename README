avr-433
-------

This software emulates the controller for some cheap remote control
plugs which used to be available at Maplin. They work on the 433.92Mhz
band with AM modulation. They can be controller with an AVR USB board
and an AM modulator - total parts cost < Â£10.

To flash the firmware to your board and to run smjctl you need 
to give your user permission on the AVR usb device. Put this in
/etc/udev/rules.d/minimus.rules:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="*", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="f055", ATTR{idProduct}=="*", GROUP="plugdev"

(First line is for the bootloader, for flashing. Second line is the 
device when running this firmware. Your user needs to be in group 
plugdev.)
